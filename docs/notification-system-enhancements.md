# Notification System Enhancement Proposals

## Current System Overview

Our notification system currently supports:

- Push notification delivery via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- Token lifecycle management (registration, refresh, invalidation)
- User targeting based on various criteria (registration date, transaction count, etc.)

**Example**:

```json
{
  "template_id": "welcome_user",
  "title": "Welcome {{userName}}! ðŸŽ‰",
  "body": "Start your journey with a {{amount}} bonus credit",
  "locales": ["en", "fr", "es"]
}
```
